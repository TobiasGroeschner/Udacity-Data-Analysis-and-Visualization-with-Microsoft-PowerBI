### Project Description

An online national clothing chain needs your help creating a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they donâ€™t know who to target. They have three products in mind:

- Shirt: $25
- Sweater: $100
- Leather Bag: $1,000

### Project Instructions

- Use population statistics from the US Census Bureau to determine where the greatest income exists around the country and whether there is a correlation between sales and income. 
- predict customer income by looking at the purchase history and locations and comparing that against census data.
- analyze inventory, specifically customer ratings and return rate & see if there is a correlation.
