### Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to create an efficient data model for a small brewing company. The business value is that it will help the company identify popular and profitable products. This will help them making smarter business decisions. The project requires understanding of data modeling principles. Data is cleaned and organized in Power Query, DAX measures are used for calculations. This project took about 3 days to complete.
